There are googlesheets and excel files I am currently saving from working 
through my coursera program and any other future projects. This repository contains
any formulas, functions, pivot tables, and graphs that I have practiced with.
Everything will be shown on duplicated sheets from the original data to be used as reference.
Most Duplicated sheets should also have comments of what was updated or added as well.

If you have any questions please message me. 
Thank you and have a wonderful day!
